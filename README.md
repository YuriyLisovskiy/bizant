[Block Chain Go](https://github.com/YuriyLisovskiy/blockchain-go) is my personal project to learn,
experiment and build around block chain technology written in
[Go](https://golang.org) programming language. This project is
not affiliated with [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com) company.

This project was inspired by [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [Dash](https://github.com/dashpay/dash) crypto currencies.
